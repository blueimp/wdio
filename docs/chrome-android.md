### Chrome on Android

To run the tests with Chrome on Android, follow these steps:

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) (release
   version "Arctic Fox" at the time of this writing) and on the welcome dialog,
   select "More Actions" => "SDK Manager", then switch to the "SDK Tools" tab
   and install the following components (if not already installed):

   - Android SDK Command-line Tools
   - Android Emulator
   - Android SDK Platform-Tools
   - Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)

   **Please Note:**  
   To be able to use a custom `/etc/hosts` file requires mounting the root file
   system as writable, which requires a supported system image for the Android
   Virtual Device (AVD), e.g.:

   > Android 9 "Pie" (Google APIs)

   System images for Android 10 "Q" or system images including the Google Play
   store do not support mounting the root file system as writable.

   Android 10's file system format.

2. Add the following lines to your `~/.profile` to make the JDK included in
   Android Studio and the installed Android SDK available to other applications:

   ```sh
   export JAVA_HOME='/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home'
   export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
   export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
   ```

3. Start the Android Virtual Device with a custom `/etc/hosts` file:

   ```sh
   bin/android-emulator.sh -hosts etc/android.hosts
   ```

4. Change the virtual device settings to enable a hardware keyboard and increase
   the internal storage:

   - In Android Studio on the welcome dialog, select "More Actions" => "AVD
     Manager", then with a right mouse click on your listed Virtual Device,
     bring up the menu and select "Edit".
   - Click on the "Show Advanced Settings" button to be able to see all
     settings.
   - Scroll to the "Memory and Storage" section and change the value of
     "Internal Storage" to `2048` (MB).
   - Scroll to the bottom of the configuration pane and mark the checkbox for
     "Enable keyboard input".
   - Click the "Finish" button and restart the virtual device.

5. Install the latest Google Chrome for Android version:

   - Download the latest
     [Google Chrome APK](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/chrome/)
     (Android Application Package) for the architecture of your emulated device
     (`x86`).
   - Drag&drop the APK file into the emulator window to install it or install it
     via command-line:
     ```sh
     adb install com.android.chrome_*.apk
     ```

6. Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

   ```sh
   brew install node
   ```

7. Make sure the necessary [Appium](https://appium.io/) dependencies for Android
   testing are installed:

   ```sh
   npx appium-doctor --android
   ```

8. Install [Appium](https://appium.io/) as global NPM package:

   ```sh
   npm install -g appium
   ```

9. Start `appium` with the provided helper script:

   ```sh
   bin/appium.sh
   ```

   This script is configured for
   [Automatic discovery of compatible Chromedriver](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/web/chromedriver.md/#automatic-discovery-of-compatible-chromedriver)
   and will download a `chromedriver` version compatible with the version of
   Chrome running on the Android device.

10. Run the tests with Chrome on Android:

    ```sh
    docker-compose run --rm wdio conf/chrome-android.js
    ```

    To run the tests in landscape orientation, provide the `ORIENTATION`
    environment variable:

    ```sh
    ORIENTATION=LANDSCAPE docker-compose run --rm wdio conf/chrome-android.js
    ```
